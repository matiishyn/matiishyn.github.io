Hi there!

Yet another attempt of mine to create my own blog. Why? It's cool, isn't it? Every experienced developer has it, don't they? 
Well, maybe, but not for my case.

First of all I was looking for a place to save and share some information. And I hope it's the right place to do it. What kind of info?
Originally this blog was created to share my professional knowledge but it may be the place to share my posts-from-life as well.

### Who am I?
My name is Ivan Matiishyn. I'm a Front-end developer, currently work and live in Poland with my family. More professional info you can find on my [LinkedIn page]({{ site.linkedin }}). I try to keep it up to date.
You can contact me via my [email](mailto:{{ site.email }}).

### Blog engine
For my previous attempts to create a blog I used [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/). It's powerful, it has a lot of beautiful themes and cool plugins.
But it's written with [PHP](php.net) which I'm not good enough in to look through source code and understand everything. 
Also every time I ended up with setting up all the configurations (domain, hosting, Wordpress) up to two days and after that I simply don't want to 
write posts any more.

But do I need all the power and beauty? No. As I wrote, it's just a place to share some texts/code. 
So I realized that need something that is already done and configured, like [Medium](https://medium.com). And actually it almost suited me, 
except code syntax highlighting, I don't like it in Medium. 

So I started looking for something quick and simple, and here's the result. This website is hosted in 
[GitHub](https://github.com) as a [GitHub Page](https://pages.github.com). As a blog engine I'm using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) - 
it's simple and static, since I don't need any databases to keep text/code, just the [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) text.
And frankly speaking I'm happy with this combination.
